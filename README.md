### 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm passionate about combining **mathematical optimization, machine learning, and platform thinking** to solve real-world problems.
Currently, I'm working on models that optimize **pricing** and **routing** for crowdsourcing logistics platforms – building smart algorithms that help systems make better, faster decisions.

My background blends **operations research**, **cloud technologies**, and hands-on experience in the **last-mile logistics** industry :package:.
I enjoy turning complex challenges into clean, data-driven solutions.

### 🚀 Current Projects

- 🧮 **Capacity Planning in Line-Haul Networks**  
  Developing an optimization model based on the **knapsack problem** to allocate limited transport capacity across a fixed line network. The model aims to balance cost efficiency and service quality under dynamic demand.

- 💰 **Dynamic Pricing Model**  
  Translating business constraints into a mathematical optimization model for pricing decisions. Focus on model formulation, constraint logic, and solver performance – using open-source tools and custom heuristics. Find [here](https://github.com/rimchmielowitz/Pricing) the MILP that combines matching-, routing-, compensation- and pricing decisions for a platfrom connecting crowdsourced driver with customers.

### :briefcase: Looking for...

A role where I can apply my skills in **data-driven decision-making**,  
**machine learning**, and **optimization modeling** – preferably in logistics, mobility, or platform-driven tech.

### ✨ Fun Facts

- I combine logistics logic with a love for simplicity – in life and in code.
- When I’m not tweaking parameters, I’m tweaking my Romanian deadlift form at the gym.
- I believe that small algorithms can lead to big changes.
